# Interactive_Task_Manager

This code implements a simple task management system that includes functionalities for user registration, task addition, task viewing, and report generation.

1. User logs in.
2. Depending on their role (admin or regular user), they can:

1. Add a task.
2. View all tasks.
3. View and manage their tasks.
4. Admins can also register new users, generate reports, and display statistics.

Reports provide an overview of tasks and user assignments.

The system relies on two files, user.txt for storing user credentials and tasks.txt for storing task details. The program ensures data persistence by reading from and writing to these files. The admin user has enhanced capabilities to manage users and view statistics.
